\section{Introduction}

Cloud infrastructures provide data storages that are virtually unlimited, elastic (i.e., scalable at run-time), 
robust (which is achieved by using replicas),  highly available and partition tolerant. 
It is known (CAP theorem~\cite{CAP}) that one system cannot provide at the same time availability, 
partition tolerance, and consistency, but has to drop one of these properties. Cloud data stores typically 
relax consistency, while providing a weaker  notions of consistency.
